**Simple Point of Sales**

This is a skeleton apps for point of sales application. I’m build this apps using Codeigniter 2 and HMVC library.

Note:
    1. As default, this apps doesn’t have database name. That’s why you will see an install page for the first time you access this apps. You just need to fill:
            * Hostname: default -> localhost. Example: localhost, 127.0.0.1, etc.
            * Database username: default -> root. It depends on your own database settings.
            * Database password: default -> ‘’ (empty string). It depends on your own database settings.
            * Database name: default -> ‘’. You can name it whatever you want.

    2. You can login to the apps using:
            * Nomor pegawai: admin
            * Password: admin

    3. Because I’m using TCPDF to create report, don’t forget to turn off pop-up blocker on your browser.
    4. Have fun :)
